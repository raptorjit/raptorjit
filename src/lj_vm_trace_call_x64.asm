;;; Execute the machine code sequence of a trace. Accepts pointers to a
;;; TraceCallState (see lj_vm_tcs.h) and the machine code as its arguments.
;;;
;;; Code generated by the JIT is rather deeply integrated into the former
;;; structure of the assembly bytecode VM. I.e., it expects certain former VM
;;; registers to preserve across interpreter/trace boundaries.
;;;
;;; Traced machine code does not honor the System V Calling Convention, we have
;;; to save and restore callee-save registers before entering trace machine
;;; code.
;;;
;;; We setup the the former DISPATCH and BASE registers with values from
;;; our TraceCallState (tcs) before calling the JITed code. The TraceCallState
;;; tcs is itself referenced by a pointer stored relatively close to DISPATCH
;;; and can thus be retrieved by trace exit handlers.
;;;
;;; The JITed code does not actually return by itself. At its end it will call
;;; a trace exit handler (our chance to copy back the execution's results into
;;; tcs) which will in turn return to lj_vm_trace_call.
